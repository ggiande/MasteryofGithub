"Commands will only work when they are called upon in the designated directory."

HOW TO CLONE A REPOSITORY ONTO MACHINE
cd ~/Path/to/file
git clone <url>             //Copied the repository into the path of a directory.
E.g. [      git clone https://github.com/ggiande/MacPuTTYPort.git      ]

HOW TO ADD FILES INTO AN EXISTING REPOSITORY
cd ~/Path/of/local/repository
git add <filename>          //this syncs the filename up to our machine
    OR
git add .           //adds all files onto the branch

git commit -m "Brief Description" //still in machine, not synced up
git push               //pushes up to github.com
    OPTIONALLY
git pull                 //pulls everything from the repository that is new | Updating


LINK A DIRECTORY TO A REPOSITORY
//Make an EMPTY repository on Github first
//On a terminal run the following commands

<Deletes .git if previously initialized in this directory>
WINDOWS: rd .git /S/Q
MACOSX: rmdir -r .git /S/Q              // ./S/Q doesn't always work so it may not be needed.

git init
git add .
git commit -m "First commit."
git remote add origin <url>

git push -u origin master   //should work if repository is EMPTY
    OR
git push -f origin master       //if repository not empty, this will overwrite EVERYTHING and only push the things under .add
